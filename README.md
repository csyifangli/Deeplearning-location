# Deeplearning-location
I use deep learning for seismic location. The model I use is a multi-layered model, which is based on real model for LiaoNing Province, China. The "matlablocate" folder contains programs to compute the travel time of direct P wave and S wave, which are used for locating. It also contains locating program using Gieger method for comparison. Then I generate input file. First I set 10000 seismic events, and I use the MATLAB program to compute the travel time of each event at every observation station. The travel time is then used as the independent variable for the train data, and the location and orgin time of the seismic events are used as dependent variable for the train data. Next I use Python with Tensorflow to "learn" the model. At last, I set 1000 seismic events, and use the travel time of them for input, and check the output given by the deep learning. Our conclusion is that, compared with Gieger method, the deep learning method is more accurate and fast, it is also more stable.
